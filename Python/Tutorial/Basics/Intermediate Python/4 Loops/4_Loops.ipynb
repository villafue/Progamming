Anyways, Python goes through this piece of code only once. After that, Python heads over to the next command in the script. The while loop is somewhat similar to an if statement: it executes the code inside if the condition is True. However, as opposed to the if statement, the while loop will continue to execute this code over and over again as long as the condition is true.\n",

As example, suppose you're numerically calculating a model based on your data. This typically involves taking the same steps over and over again, until the error between your model and your data is below some boundary. When you can reformulate the problem as 'repeating an action until a particular condition is met', a while loop is often the way to go. Say that we start with an error of fifty and that our fancy algorithm divides the error by four on each run. We want to keep going until the error is no longer above 1.\n",

In the condition part, we write error > 1, so that the while loop executes again as long as the error is above 1. Inside the code, we divide the error by four and update the error variable. This kind of simulates our fancy algorithm that divides the error by four on every run. Next, we also print this error. Let's go through what happens if you actually run this script, step by step.\n",

Notice that inside this while loop, this update of error is crucial: the error had to go down to become lower than 1 at some point.\n",

        "9. While\n",
        "Suppose that we comment out these updates of the error value, and run the script again. The error isn't updated, so the condition is always True and the while loop will go on forever. On DataCamp, this will cause your session to be disconnected. If you're making this mistake on your own system, you will have to interrupt the python program by pressing the control and C keys.\n",

Now, enumerate(fam) produces two values on each iteration: the index of the value, and the value itself. Instead of a single variable height, you now write index, height. Now, on each iteration, index will contain the index, and height will contain the float. This means that we can now also update the statement inside the for loop with a more complicated print() call.

Well, in both cases, you can use a similar for loop construct, but the way you define the \"sequence\" over which you're iterating will differ depending on the data structure.\n",

        "2. Dictionary\n",
        "Let's go back to our \"world\" dictionary, containing country names as keys and corresponding populations as values, shown here. How should we approach this if we want to print out the key and corresponding value for each key:value pair on a new line? Maybe like this, simply hoping that the key and value are correctly set? Unfortunately, we get an error. Python sees that you expect two values in every iteration, like enumerate did before when you wanted the index and value from a list element, but in this case, Python has no idea how to go about this.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Dictionary\n",
        "We can fix this by calling the method items() on world. This will generate a key and value in each iteration. If you have a look at the printout, there's something strange: afghanistan comes first in world, but not in the printout. That's because dictionaries are inherently unordered: the order in which they're iterated over is not fixed, at least in Python 3.5.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Dictionary\n",
        "The names key and value are totally arbitrary by the way, I can also call these k and v, like here. The order does matter though. The first variable gets the key, the second one the value.\n",
        "\n",

        "Now for the Numpy array, that \"data science equivalent\" of the Python list I've been talking about quite a bit. Let's start from the bmi array that you already know -- here it is. It's pretty straightforward: the most basic for loop you can imagine already does the trick.\n",

        "Let's see if this also works with a 2D Numpy array. Here, I created meas, by combining the np_height and np_weight arrays. If we want to print out each element in this 2D array separately, the same basic for loop won't do the trick though. The 2D array is actually built up from an array of 1D arrays. The for loop simply prints out an entire array on each iteration.\n",

Pay attention here: dictionaries require a method, Numpy arrays use a function.\n",
