        "\n",
        "2. Pokémon Overview\n",
        "The Pokémon game centers around players called trainers that try to collect fictional animals called Pokémon.\n",
        "\n",

        "These Pokémon animals roam the fictional universe where the game takes place. When a trainer encounters a Pokémon, they try to capture that Pokémon to add to their collection.\n",

        "If a trainer successfully captures a Pokémon, it is stored in a tool called a Pokédex.\n",

        "6. Pokémon Description\n",
        "This metadata contains a name for each Pokémon. It also has the generation of each Pokémon specifying what version of the game the Pokémon appears in. Here, Squirtle, a Pokémon from generation one, is shown.\n",

        "Suppose we have two lists: one of Pokémon names and another of each Pokémon's Health Points. We want to combine these lists so that each Pokémon is stored next to its Health Points.

        "10. Combining objects with zip\n",
        "But Python's built-in function zip provides a more elegant solution. The name \"zip\" describes how this function combines objects like a zipper on a jacket (making two separate things become one). zip returns a zip object that must be unpacked into a list and printed to see the contents.

We'd like to create a dictionary where each key is a Pokémon type, and each value is the count of characters that belong to that type. Using a standard dictionary approach, we have to instantiate an empty output dictionary. Then, we iterate over the poke_types list and check whether or not each poke_type exists within the type_counts dictionary. If the poke_type is not in the dictionary, we create a new key and initialize its count value as one. If the poke_type is already in the dictionary, we update the count by one.\n",

Counter returns a Counter dictionary of key-value pairs. When printed, it's ordered by highest to lowest counts. If comparing runtime times, we'd see that using Counter takes half the time as the standard dictionary approach!\n",

        "17. Combinations with loop\n",
        "Suppose we want to gather all combination pairs of Pokémon types possible. We can do this with a nested for loop that iterates over the poke_types list twice. Notice that a conditional statement is used to skip pairs having the same type twice. For example, if x is 'Bug' and y is 'Bug', we want to skip this pair. Since we're interested in combinations (where order doesn't matter), another statement is used to ensure either order of the pair doesn't already exist within the combos list before appending it. For example, the pair ('Bug', 'Fire') is the same as the pair ('Fire', 'Bug'). We want one of these pairs, not both.\n",
        "\n",

        "The combinations generator from itertools provides a more efficient solution. First, we import combinations and then create a combinations object by providing the poke_types list and the length of combinations we desire. combinations returns a combinations object, which we unpack into a list and print to see the result. If comparing runtimes, we'd see using combinations is significantly faster than the nested loop.\n",
