Course Description

Coding interviews can be challenging. You might be asked questions to test your knowledge of a programming language. On the other side, you can be given a task to solve in order to check how you think. And when you are interviewed for a data scientist position, it's likely you can be asked on the corresponding tools available for the language. In either of the cases, to get a cool position as a data scientist, you need to do a little work to perform the best. That's why it's very important to practice in order to prove your expertise! This course serves as a guide for those who just start their path to become a professional data scientist and as a refresher for those who seek for other opportunities. We'll go through fundamental as well as advanced topics that aim to prepare you for a coding interview in Python. Since it is not a normal step-by-step course, some exercises can be quite complex. But who said that interviews are easy to pass, right?
