        "1. Using dictionaries\n",
        "\n",
        "Now that you are familiar with the container sequence types, let's dive into dictionaries. People often joke that everything in Python is a dictionary, and while it is a joke, there is a tiny bit of truth to that. I find myself using dictionaries the most of any container type. Dictionary are useful for storing key/value pair, grouping data by time or structuring hierarchical data like org charts. Let's take a look.\n",
        "2. Creating and looping through dictionaries\n",
        "\n",
        "Dictionaries hold data in key/value pairs. While the key must be alphanumeric, the value can be any other data type. It's also possible to nest dictionaries so that you can work with grouped or hierarchical data. We can also iterate over the keys and values of a dictionary. We can also iterate over the items of a dictionary, which are tuples of the key value pairs)! We create dictionaries using the dict() method or the braces shortcut. Here, I've got a list of tuples containing the name and zip for New York City Art Galleries. I'd like to turn that into a dictionary so I can quickly find the zip code without having to scan the whole list. I begin by creating an empty dictionary named art_galleries. Next I use tuple unpacking as I loop over the galleries list that contains my data. Then inside the loop I set the name of the gallery as the key in my dictionary and the zip code as the value. Finally, I'd like to find the last 5 art gallery names. By default when using sorted on a dictionary or looping over a dictionary we loop over the keys. So we'll print the keys which are names. Let's talk more about accessing dictionary values by key.\n",
        "3. Printing in the loop\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Safely finding by key\n",
        "\n",
        "Here I'm looking for the Louvre gallery in New York City, but it's in Paris and throws an exception. Often you will know the key you want to get from the dictionary, and using the key as an index value to get the data. However, if the key is not present you will get an ugly exception that stops the execution of your code. While you could use Python exception handling, this is so common that dictionaries have a get() method just for this problem.\n",
        "5. Safely finding by key (cont.)\n",
        "\n",
        "The get method allows you to safely get a value from a key by passing the key. If the key is not found in the dictionary, it returns None. You can optionally supply a second argument which will be returned instead of None. Continuing from the prior example of looking for the Louvre, I make the same request with the get method, and supply the string Not Found to be returned if it is not present, which is exactly what happens. Finally, I supplied a valid key to the get() method and it returned the value from the dictionary. Accessing data in a safe manner is critical to ensure your programs execute properly. Let's learn more about nested data.\n",
        "6. Working with nested dictionaries\n",
        "\n",
        "I mentioned earlier that you can also nest dictionaries to group data or establish a hierarchy. I've reorganized my prior art galleries dictionary to by keyed by zip code and then gallery name with the value of their phone number. I can use the keys() method to see the list of zip code keys. I can print the value of one of those zip codes so you can see the dictionary nested under it,\n",
        "7. Accessing nested data\n",
        "\n",
        "and I can get the phone number of one of those galleries by using the gallery name which is the nested dictionary's key as a secondary index. Nesting dictionaries is a very common way to deal with repeating data structures such as yearly data, grouped, or hierarchical data such as organization reporting structures. You access nested values by providing multiple indices to the dictionary or using the get method on an index.\n",

I have a dictionary that contains the art galleries in the 10007 zip code and I want to add it to my art_galleries dictionary. I assign the zip code as the key and then the dictionary as the value.\n",

        "The csv module also provides a way to directly create a dictionary from a CSV file with the DictReader class. If the file has a header row, that row will automatically be used as the keys for the dictionary. However, if not, you can supply a list of keys to be used. Each row from the file is returned as a dictionary. Using DictReader can make it much easier to read your code and understand what data is being used, especially when compared to the numbered indexes you used in the prior exercise.\n",
